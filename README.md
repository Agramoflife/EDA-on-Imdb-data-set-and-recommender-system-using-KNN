## Movie Recommender System - EDA and KNN Analysis

**Welcome to the project repository for our Movie Recommender System!**

This project aims to assist a rookie movie producer in making informed decisions about future film productions. We will leverage a dataset of 3000 movies and their details to explore trends, identify profitable elements, and ultimately recommend optimal genres, actors, and production strategies.

### Problem Statement:

* Analyze the provided movie dataset to gain insights for the producer.
* Answer key questions including:
    * Highest-grossing movie, its producers, director, and cast.
    * Language with the highest average ROI.
    * Unique movie genres.
    * Top 3 producers based on average movie ROI.
    * Most prolific actor and their film involvement.
    * Top 3 director-actor collaborations.

### Data Exploration:

This section dives deep into the provided dataset, covering aspects like:

* Data cleaning and sanity checks.
* Descriptive statistics.
* Visualizations to understand data distribution and relationships.
* Feature engineering for KNN analysis.

### KNN Analysis:

We will implement a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to:

* Recommend movies similar to a given movie based on features like genre, cast, and crew.
* Predict the potential success of a new movie based on similar existing films.

### Project Structure:

* `data`: Directory containing the movie dataset.
* `EDA`: Python scripts for data exploration and analysis.
* `KNN`: Implementation of KNN algorithm for recommendation and prediction.
* `docs`: Documentation, including this README.md and any further reports.

### Getting Started:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up the development environment with the required libraries (e.g., pandas, scikit-learn).
3. Run the scripts in the `EDA` and `KNN` directories to explore and analyze the data.
4. Refer to the documentation and results to gain insights and answer the problem statement questions.

### Contributions:

Feel free to contribute by:

* Forking the repository and adding your own analysis or visualization code.
* Reporting any issues or suggesting improvements.
* Sharing your insights and learnings in the project documentation.

**Let's embark on this data-driven journey to unlock the secrets of successful movie production!**

**Note:** This readme provides a general structure and outline. You can customize it further with specific details like technologies used, expected outputs, and contribution guidelines.
